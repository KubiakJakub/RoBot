# RoBot

**The robot itself will be able to overcome obstacles on its own and transfer data wirelessly.**

A project designed to develop knowledge and gain practical experience
The project will consist of several phases (updated from time to time) in which I will gradually implement my goals with the project.

###Phases:
 1. **The first cats behind the fences.**
    1. Assembly
    2. Connecting electronic parts with each other
    3. Test run
 2. **PC application for remote control of the robot.**
    1. Testing wireless comunication with program 
    2. Fancy arrangement of the windows in app
    3. basic robot control
    4. Checking that nothing will explode
 3. **Real wirelles**
    1. power system with protection
    2. Battery pack
    3. Checking if nothing explodes or turns into a fire on wheels
 4. **A primitive sense of space**
    1. Fitting the ultrasonic sensors
    2. Make simple program
    3. Functil program + testing
    4. working program
